# Project Two
---

**Repository**

This repository contains my submission for the Programming for Data Analysis module Project 2 at ATU as part of the ATU HDip in Data Analytics. The body of the work is in the Jupyter Notebook. The Jupyter Notebook Project_2.ipynb can be viewed directly in this GitHub repository in a browser.

# An Analysis of Paleo-Present Climate Data

This project aims to delve into the intricate relationship between various climate indicators from the paleo era to the present day. The key areas of focus include:

- **CO2 vs Temperature Anomaly (800kyrs â€“ Present):** A thorough examination of the correlation between carbon dioxide levels and temperature anomalies over the last 800,000 years.

- **Additional Climate Features Analysis:** Studying another significant aspect such as methane (CH4) levels or polar ice-coverage. This will provide a broader understanding of the climate changes.

- **Irish Climate Context:** Investigating the specific climate change signals in Ireland. This will be based on studies like the Maynooth study titled "The emergence of a climate change signal in long-term Irish meteorological observations" available on ScienceDirect.

- **Data Fusion and Analysis:** Merging data from various sources and formatting the combined dataset into a pandas dataframe. This fused dataset will be exported in both CSV and JSON formats for further analysis.

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis:** For all the variables (CO2, Temperature, CH4, etc.), the task will be to analyze the data, identify trends, and explore the relationships between them. This will include looking into temporal leads/lags and frequency analysis.

- **Future Global Temperature Anomaly Prediction:** Using the synthesized data to predict the global temperature anomaly for the next few decades. These predictions will be compared with published climate models, assuming the current trends in atmospheric CO2 continue.

- **Commentary on Accelerated Warming:** Based on the very latest data, such as temperature records and polar ice-coverage, provide insights into the accelerated pace of global warming.
