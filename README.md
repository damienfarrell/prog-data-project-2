# Project Two
---

**Repository**

This repository contains my submission for the Programming for Data Analysis module Project 2 at ATU as part of the ATU HDip in Data Analytics. The body of the work is in the Jupyter Notebook. The Jupyter Notebook Project_2.ipynb can be viewed directly in this GitHub repository in a browser.

**Project**

## An Analysis of Paleo-Present Climate Data

- Analyse CO2 vs Temperature Anomaly from 800kyrs â€“ present.
- Examine one other (paleo/modern) features (e.g. CH4 or polar ice-coverage)
- Examine Irish context:
  - Climate change signals: (see Maynooth study: The emergence of a climate change signal in long-term Irish meteorological observations - ScienceDirect)
- Fuse and analyse data from various data sources and format fused data set as a pandas dataframe and export to csv and json formats
- For all of the above variables, analyse the data, the trends and the relationships between them (temporal leads/lags/frequency analysis).
- Predict global temperature anomaly over next few decades (synthesise data) and compare to published climate models if atmospheric CO2 trends continue
- Comment on accelerated warming based on very latest features (e.g. temperature/polar-ice-coverage)
